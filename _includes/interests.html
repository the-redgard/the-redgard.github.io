			    My personal interests include:
        </p>
			<ul>
			  <li>
				 <b>React JS learning</b>. React is fast, scalable, and flexible. Apps made in React can handle complex updates and still feel quick and responsive.
			  </li>
			  <li>
				<b>Test Monitoring</b>. I've been working on many projects where the progress status is really important
				but is providing separately by each member of the team with some visibility about the test results for the manager
			  feedback on how the testing work is going could be hard, allowing opportunities to guide and improve this stage of the application lifecycle.
			  </li>
			  <li>
				  <b>Running, Hiking, Workout</b>. Aside from learning new skills, new technologies, or add new test frameworks. 
				I enjoy spending weekends exploring San Diego, running in groups, and biking. 
			  </li>			 
			</ul>
